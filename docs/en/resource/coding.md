# Programmatically Access the Documentation

This documentation is designed for deep integration into AI workflows. You can seamlessly connect it to your development environment via AI assistants, IDE plugins, or the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for efficient, automated content retrieval and invocation.

## Quick Markdown Copy

A convenient **Copy button** is located in the upper-right corner of every documentation page:

<p align="center">
  <img src="../../assets/img/coding-en.png" alt="Copy button illustration">
</p>

**Steps:**

1. Click the copy button in the upper-right corner.

2. The complete Markdown content of the current page is automatically copied to your clipboard.

3. Paste it directly into your code editor (e.g., VS Code) or an AI assistant dialog (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) and start using it right away.

## Integration via MCP

This documentation is synchronized to the [Context7](https://context7.com/) platform and can be invoked directly through Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools.

**How to configure:**
Refer to the [Context7 MCP tool configuration guide](https://context7.com/docs) to learn how to connect and configure MCP tools in your code editor or AI assistant.

!!! note "Search tip"
    Because the Context7 library indexes three historical versions of this project, explicitly prompt the AI to **"please consult the most recently updated version of the documentation"** to ensure it retrieves the latest content.

## Best-practice recommendation

Given that Context7's content sync cycle is roughly two weeks, search results may lag behind. **To guarantee accuracy and real-time freshness, always prefer the "Copy" button in the upper-right corner** to obtain the latest Markdown content instead of relying on Context7's cached data.
